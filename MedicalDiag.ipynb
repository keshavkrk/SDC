            "Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterized by progressive retinal vascular damage that ultimately causes vision loss. The prognostic nutritional index (PNI), which integrates albumin and lymphocytes, serves as an indicator of an individual's inflammatory response, nutritional condition, and immune system function. This research aimed to explore the possible association between PNI and DR. This was a cross-sectional study utilizing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2001 and 2018. Weighted logistic regression analyses were employed to assess the relationship between PNI and DR prevalence. A total of 4791 adults aged 20 years and older were included in the analysis. Results indicated a statistically significant negative correlation between PNI and DR prevalence. In the fully adjusted model, a one-unit rise in PNI corresponded to a 7% reduction in the probability of DR prevalence. Quartile analysis consistently indicated that individuals in the highest PNI quartile had notably lower odds of DR prevalence compared to those in the lowest quartile. Additionally, smooth curve fitting suggested a nonlinear relationship between PNI and DR. Subgroup analysis reinforced the strength of the inverse association between PNI and DR (all p for interaction > 0.05). This nationally representative study demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between PNI levels and DR prevalence among diabetic adults in the United States. Our findings emphasize the potential role of maintaining optimal PNI values in preventing the development of DR.\n",

            "Abstract: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely associated with an increased risk and adverse event of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The present study aims to investigate the association between differential urinary metabolites and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with ACS co-morbid T2DM with preserved renal function, and to explore the potential value of the metabolites as prognostic biomarkers in this population. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) was used to analyze urine samples from ACS co-morbid T2DM. Spearman's correlation was used to examine the association between differential metabolites and serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), Syntax score I, and MACE. The Cox proportional hazards models and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to identify MACE risk factors. A total of 101 differential urinary metabolites were identified, of which seven showed a correlation with FBG, HbA1c, Syntax score I and MACE. In particular, myo-inositol and (E)-Monocrotophos emerged as significant indicators of poor prognosis in ACS co-morbid with T2DM. Urinary metabolomic alteration is closely associated with clinical manifestation of ACS co-morbid T2DM. Urinary myo-inositol and (E)-Monocrotophos may be considered as prognostic biomarkers of ACS co-morbid T2DM.\n",

            "Abstract: Despite advances in medical mycology, invasive Trichosporon spp infections continue to be associated with high mortality rates. Limited data exist on the risk factors and outcomes of Trichosporon fungemia, particularly in our region. Therefore, this study aims to describe the risk factors, patient characteristics, antifungal susceptibility, and outcome of Trichosporon bloodstream infections at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia. This was a single-center retrospective chart review that included adult patients ≥ 16 years with positive blood cultures for Trichosporon spp from January-2016 to December-2022. Descriptive statistics are presented using the mean for continuous variables and the number (percentage) for categorical variables. Ten patients with Trichosporon spp isolated from blood cultures were eligible for inclusion in this study. The mean age was 58.1 years (range 17-83), with 70% male patients. Additionally, 40% had diabetes mellitus, and 40% had underlying malignancy. Trichosporon asahii was the predominant species in 90% of isolates. All patients had recent broad-spectrum antibiotic use, 80% were exposed to corticosteroids, and all had central venous catheters (CVC). One kidney transplant had an early recurrence of Trichosporon spp fungemia. Four patients were cured of the infection, two were treated with voriconazole monotherapy, and two were treated with a combination of liposomal amphotericin B plus Voriconazole. 30-day all-cause mortality was 60%, with three deaths occurring before identification of the isolates. In conclusion, our study reported a predominance of Trichosporon asahii and a mortality rate of 60% in patients with Trichosporon fungemia. Challenges include delayed diagnosis, high mortality, and antifungal resistance, underscoring the need for further research to enhance treatment strategies and patient outcomes.\n",

A man in his 80s with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hypothyroidism presented with altered mental status for 8 months. He was previously diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, but therapy was discontinued due to infection. On presentation, he was wheelchair-bound with disorientation, proximal weakness, hyporeflexia and bradykinesia. MRI brain showed atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed mildly elevated protein (58.8 mg/dL) without pleocytosis. Despite treatment for urinary tract infection and septic encephalopathy, his sensorium did not improve. A diagnosis of possible autoimmune encephalitis was considered, though antibody studies were negative. Whole-body Positron Emission Tomography - Computerized Tomography (PET-CT) ruled out malignancy and showed global hypokinesia, while echocardiography showed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Positive acetylcholine receptor antibody led to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, which improved his sensorium and cardiac dysfunction suggesting a positive association.\n",

            "Abstract: The study aimed to investigate the effect of early postoperative ambulation on gait recovery at the initial postoperative week and at discharge after hip fracture surgery in older patients. In this prospective cohort study, 882 patients aged ≥ 65 years from 10 acute hospitals in Japan were divided into early-ambulation (EA) (ambulation initiated on postoperative day 1 or 2) and late-ambulation (LA) (ambulation initiated on postoperative day 3 or later) groups. The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) was assessed 1 day postoperatively, 1 week postoperatively, and at discharge. Independent walking regardless of walking aids was defined as walking FIM ≥ 5. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and a generalized linear mixed model, accounting for inter-hospital variability, determined whether EA affected independent walking at 1 week postoperatively and at discharge. The number of patients walking independently 1 week postoperatively and at discharge was 156 (17.7%) and 292 (33.1%), respectively. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, EA was associated with independent walking at 1 week postoperatively (odds ratio [OR] 3.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.17-4.94; P < 0.0001) and at discharge (OR 3.33; 95% CI 2.38-4.69; P < 0.0001).

We found that the overexpression of IFI6 under the influence of the AHSA1-HSP90AA1 complex significantly enhances Osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma cells. This effect is achieved by stabilizing mitochondrial function, reducing apoptosis, and promoting cell survival pathways via increased Akt phosphorylation. Additionally, we revealed that TGFB1 further promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhances the invasive and migratory capabilities of these cells, thereby intensifying resistance. Regarding mechanisms, the AHSA1-HSP90AA1 complex stabilizes IFI6 and TGFB1 to enhance cell survival and Osimertinib resistance in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma. IFI6 not only aids in cellular survival under drug stress but also promotes aggressive tumor phenotypes, suggesting its viability as a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for overcoming primary TKI resistance.\n",
